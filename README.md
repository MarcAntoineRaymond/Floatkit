# Floatkit

**Floatkit** is a lightweight, extensible C++ application that lets you display and animate 2D sprites **over your desktop and windows** — like a floating character or animated overlay that lives on your screen.

Designed for playful desktop companions, animated mascots, or interactive overlays, Floatkit provides a flexible foundation for screen-top sprites that can move, respond, and evolve.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Build Instructions

No Make file for now, I use visual studio to build it, so you can open the solution file and build it there.

### Load an image

The application add a notify icon that shows a menu.

With the Options button you can load a custom cfg file defining sprites names, animation speed and other confgiuration.

Look at the sample cfg file and sprites in the repository to see how to define your sprites.
